## JDK / JRE / JVM Explanation

* **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Includes compiler (`javac`), tools, and the runtime environment to develop and run Java applications.
* **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** Includes the JVM and libraries required to run Java applications but no compiler.
* **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Executes Java bytecode and provides platform independence.

## Windows Installation Steps

1. Download JDK installer from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/).
2. Run the installer and follow the wizard.
3. Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:

   * Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.
   * Create a new variable `JAVA_HOME` pointing to JDK installation directory.
4. Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the `Path` variable.
5. Verify installation by running:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

## Eclipse Setup Steps

1. Download and install Eclipse IDE from [eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2. Open Eclipse and create a new Java Project.
3. Copy source files to the projectâ€™s `src` folder.
4. Right-click `Main.java` > Run As > Java Application.
5. Program output should display in the Console.

## Notes on Enabling Assertions

* Enable assertions by running Java with the `-ea` flag:

  ```bash
  java -ea -cp out edu.ccrm.AssertionsDemo
  ```
* Assertions are used to verify assumptions in code and can be enabled/disabled at runtime.
* Example assertion in code:

  ```java
  assert x > 0 : "x must be positive";
  ```
